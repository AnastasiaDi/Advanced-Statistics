# Advanced-Statistics

The github repository consists of two folders (branches)

One branch 'exercises' consists of the exercises made during the lectures. Each file consists of small exercises to practice the commands that are taught in the lecture. The other branch contains the assignments.

For the assignments, I would like to ask you to:

    Download the dataset and the assignment file into your Rstudio environment.
    Make the assignment in R. Fill in your answers (both R code and interpretation) between the lines.
    Copy the assignment file with answers in your github account (edit).
    Share them with me (fork).

You can find the literature (or links to the papers) under 'issues'.
